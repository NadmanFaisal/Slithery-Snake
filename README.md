Introducing the top panel

After clicking the start button, a small snake and a fruit will appear on the screen, along with a top panel with a play button and another button to change the color of the snake. To get the snake moving, you click the play button. The toxic fruit appears randomly during the game.

The “Change Color” button changes the color of the snake. The color of the snake can be changed mid-game. Currently there are 4 different colors of the snake -



Introducing the playable panel

The “Slithery Snake” game consists of the Snake, normal berries, toxic berries and invincible food. As the snake moves, it can eat the fruit. The snake eats the fruit when the head of the snake and the fruit comes in contact. Each time the snake eats the fruit it grows longer and each time it eats the toxic fruit it gets halved in size. Eating the normal fruit will increase the score count.

Use the arrow keys to change the direction the snake is moving in. The snake can be moved around in four directions - up, down, left, and right using the arrow keys on the computer. The user can manipulate the snake to move in the specified directions with the help of the up, down, left, and right keys on the keyboard. The snake will keep on moving in the same direction until the direction is changed -


The “Up arrow” key changes direction of the snake to face towards the top of the panel -

The “Down arrow” key changes the direction of snake towards the bottom panel -

The “Left arrow” key changes direction of snake toward the left of the panel -

The “Right arrow” key changes the direction of the snake towards the right of the panel -

The snake dies and the game is over when the snake collides with its own body or when it collides with the game boundaries, which is marked in red, in the picture below.


The panel indicates score. The score count increases or decreases according to the type of food eaten -


The panel also has a timer. The timer keeps track of time. Timer goes on as long as the “Game Over” screen is not shown -




The snake can eat three different foods - food, toxic food, and invincible food. The food spawns at random places throughout the screen. The snake grows by one unit (body length) when it eats the food. The score also increases by 10 when food is eaten by snake. Representation of food is shown below -


Toxic food spawns at random places throughout the screen. Rate at which the toxic food spawns is random. It can spawn at any location on the screen. Snake divides its body length by half when it eats toxic food. Score also dresses to half the value when a toxic food is eaten. Representation of the toxic food is shown below -


Last kind of edible item is invincible food. It is a power up. When eaten, it stops snake from killing itself for 10 seconds. User can make the snake to move within itself within this time frame. Snake still dies when it touches the screen border. Rate at which invincible food spawns is random. It can spawn on any location of the screen. Representation of invincible food (power up) is shown below -



Introducing the Game Over screen

Game over screen has “Restart” button. To navigate to the playable screen to start playing the game, press “Restart” button.
